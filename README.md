[COMPLETE] Art Reference site project

My final individual project during my time training with QAC.

This website is a small image board website for searching and uploading images to use for references for any artwork. 

You can search the artwork via tags which can be searched in the dropdown menus on the search page.

You can search for specific artists to specific poses and everything in between.
